Just as a note, this repo automatically syncs with https://gitlab.com/BigSpaceships/VR-Visualization-Water-World, which can be accessed at school without any shenanigans

Let me know if you need access to either repositories and I'll give you access

Also, please use unity [2023.2.20f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2023.2.20) as it is installed on the computers at school so we can avoid version issues every time we open the project
